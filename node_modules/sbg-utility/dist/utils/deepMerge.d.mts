/**
 * Deeply merges two values, handling arrays, objects, and special types.
 *
 * - If both values are arrays, merges by index, unions nested arrays, and merges objects/maps/sets/functions at the same index.
 * - If both values are objects, merges properties recursively, handling special types (`Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `RegExp`, `Function`).
 * - If types differ, source replaces target.
 * - Handles circular references.
 *
 * @param target - The target value to merge into.
 * @param source - The source value to merge from.
 * @param seen - Internal WeakMap to track circular references.
 * @returns The deeply merged value.
